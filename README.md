# Trakt Plugin
This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://github.com/obsidianmd).

It is loosely based on https://github.com/Fleker/trakt-for-obsidian but largely redesigned to store shows as seperate note files with ratings, watch progress and the ability to write notes within those files and continue to sync with trakt after doing so.

The main motivator for this plugin is to be able to link to specific shows from other notes with a centralised automatically generated system for TV shows and movies.
